title: Auto-updated visualisations of COVID-19 cases by geographical area.

In 2020, during the first significant COVID-19 wave to have occurred in Victoria, Australia, I created an automatically updating interactive of daily case numbers, by LGA (local government area). 

In addition, I created videos showing showing how case numbers evolved across Greater Melbourne and Victoria. 

These are published [here](https://amanjitgill.com/covid_vic_2020/). I'm in the process of moving the interactive to another server, so it may not appear for a few days.
