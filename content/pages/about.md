title: About

### Hi, I'm Amanjit.

This blog is where I share what I've learned, and my opinions, on:

- data science and analysis 
- mathematics and statistical theory
- programming and computing

I value precision; I never deliberately make untrue or misleading claims. That said, this is a blog, not investigative journalism, so I try to constrain my research efforts to reasonable limits before publishing my posts. Also, obviously, the opinions I express here are my own, not those of any employer or organisation.

### My background

- Studied engineering (mechatronics) and computer science. 
- Worked in industry, then undertook a graduate diploma in education (secondary).
- Taught mathematics, and occasionally IT and robotics, at high school level.
- Recently completed a master's degree in data science.
