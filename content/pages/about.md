title: About

## Welcome.

Thank you for visiting.

This blog is where I share what I've learned, and my opinions, on:

- programming
- computing
- data analysis and data science
- mathematics

I value precision and accuracy. This sometimes causes me to over-research, so I'm intentionally limiting the amount of preparation I do before publishing posts. 

This is, after all, a blog; it's not investigative journalism. That said, I never deliberately make unfair claims, and I always link to the sources I've used.

## My background

- Studied engineering (mechatronics) and computer science. 
- Worked in industry, then undertook a graduate diploma in education (secondary).
- Taught mathematics, and occasionally IT and robotics, at high school level.
- Currently undertaking a master's degree in data science, and loving it.
